# Bloody Mess!
A back-to-basics weapon/monster mod.
---

## What?
I wanted to make something simple, but interesting. Something that would evoke the feel of the good ol' days of grabbing random shit off realm667, but would have the design sensibilities of more modern games like Doom Eternal, while also borrowing the coolest parts of Quake.

## How do I start?

### QUICK TIPS
1. Enemies drop *Armor Shards* when you do enough damage to *Stagger* them, and drop *Health Bits* when you kill them. Over-armor and over-heal will decay over time, though, so always look for a quick kill to top yourself off!
2. Killing enemies with your *Bolter Pistol* or the *Undertaker* causes them to drop ammo instead of health. The *Bolter Pistol* also does up to 2x damage on weakened enemies! Use it to build up ammo, but watch your health...
3. Stagger an enemy with the *Thermite Grinder* to turn the armor bits into nasty Thermite Bombs! Damage the Thermite Bombs with another weapon to set them off, sending them flying away.
